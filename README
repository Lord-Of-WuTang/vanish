# 🕵️‍♂️ Vanishing Customers: A Data Story

## 📖 Overview

This project investigates a retail company's declining customer purchases over the past 6 months. Inspired by Coursera’s lecture on [Visualization and Dashboarding Software](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-data-analytics/lecture/5pS4E/introduction-to-visualization-and-dashboarding-software), it transforms raw data into a compelling narrative using Python.

## 🎯 Scenario

> After a major website redesign, mobile users struggled to navigate the new layout. Purchases dropped, bounce rates increased, and marketing campaigns failed to highlight popular products.
